# ::tok A large group of airplanes are parked in a desert area . <next_sent> The planes are of different sizes and are arranged in a row . <next_sent> Some of the planes are white , while others are silver . <next_sent> The planes are parked in a line , with some planes closer to the foreground and others further back . <next_sent> The scene is reminiscent of an airplane graveyard .
