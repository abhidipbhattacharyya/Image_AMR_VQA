# ::tok A large clock tower stands tall in the background , while a cluster of blue glass objects , possibly crystals , are piled up in front of it . <next_sent> The clock is positioned near the top of the tower , and the blue glass objects are scattered throughout the scene , with some closer to the tower and others further away . <next_sent> The combination of the clock tower and the blue glass creates an interesting contrast between the old and new , as well as the natural and man - made elements in the scene .
