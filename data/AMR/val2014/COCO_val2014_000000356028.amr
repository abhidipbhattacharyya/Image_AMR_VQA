# ::tok The image is an old black and white photo of a dormitory . <next_sent> The dormitory has a long row of beds , with each bed having a white sheet and pillow . <next_sent> The beds are arranged in a neat row , with some of them placed next to each other . <next_sent> The dormitory has a total of 14 beds , with some beds being closer to the foreground and others further back . <next_sent> The overall atmosphere of the photo is nostalgic , reminiscent of a time when dormitories were a common place for students to stay .
