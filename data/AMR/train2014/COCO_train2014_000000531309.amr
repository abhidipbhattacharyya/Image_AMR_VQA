# ::tok The image shows a large airplane graveyard filled with various airplanes . <next_sent> There are at least 13 airplanes in the scene , some of which are parked in rows while others are scattered throughout the area . <next_sent> The airplanes vary in size and are positioned in different orientations , creating a sense of depth and complexity in the scene . <next_sent> The graveyard appears to be a place where old airplanes are stored or displayed , with some of the planes being covered in dirt , indicating their age or lack of maintenance .
