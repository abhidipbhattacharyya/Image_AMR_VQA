# ::tok A pile of pipes and valves are sitting on the ground . <next_sent> The pipes are in various sizes and colors , including red and black . <next_sent> Some of the pipes are stacked on top of each other , while others are laying flat on the ground . <next_sent> The valves are scattered throughout the pile , with some being larger and others smaller . <next_sent> The scene appears to be a storage area for these pipes and valves .
