# ::tok A blue dumpster is filled with a bunch of bananas that are starting to rot . <next_sent> The bananas are in various stages of decay , with some appearing to be rotten and others still somewhat fresh . <next_sent> The bananas are scattered throughout the dumpster , with some bunches being larger and others smaller . <next_sent> The overall scene gives off a sense of decay and waste .
