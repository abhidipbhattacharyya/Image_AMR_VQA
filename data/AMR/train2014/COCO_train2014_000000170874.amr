# ::tok The sun is setting over the ocean , casting a warm glow over the water . <next_sent> Two surfboards are floating on the water , one closer to the left side and the other further to the right . <next_sent> The surfboards are positioned in a way that they appear to be standing up , possibly waiting for their owners to ride the waves . <next_sent> The scene is serene and picturesque , with the sun setting in the background and the surfboards gently floating on the water .
