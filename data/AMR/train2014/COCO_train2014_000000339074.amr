# ::tok The image is a black and white photo of a horse - drawn carriage on a city street . <next_sent> The carriage is moving down the street , with a horse pulling it . <next_sent> There are several people on the street , some of them walking and others standing . <next_sent> The people are scattered throughout the scene , with some closer to the carriage and others further away . <next_sent> The overall atmosphere of the photo is nostalgic , reminiscent of a time when horse - drawn carriages were a common mode of transportation in cities .
