# ::tok The image features a large orange and black train on the tracks . <next_sent> The train is positioned on the left side of the image , and it is the main focus of the scene . <next_sent> The tracks are located near a field , and there is another train visible in the background on the right side of the image . <next_sent> The presence of two trains on the tracks suggests that this could be a busy transportation hub or a location where trains frequently pass by .
