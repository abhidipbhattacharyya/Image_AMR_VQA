# ::tok Three planes are flying in formation through the sky . <next_sent> The planes are blue and white , and they are flying in a straight line . <next_sent> The sky is cloudy , and the planes are leaving trails behind them . <next_sent> The planes are flying in a formation , with one plane slightly behind the other two . <next_sent> The planes are flying at a relatively low altitude , as they are close to the ground .
