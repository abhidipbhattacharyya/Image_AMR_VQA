# ::tok Two women are walking down a rain - soaked street , each holding an umbrella to protect themselves from the rain . <next_sent> They are walking next to each other , with one woman slightly ahead of the other . <next_sent> The street is lined with cars parked on the side , and there is a handbag visible near the women . <next_sent> The scene is black and white , adding a sense of nostalgia to the image .
